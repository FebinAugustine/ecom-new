# Plan for Project README.md

This document outlines the plan for creating a comprehensive `README.md` file for the e-commerce backend project.

## Objective

The `README.md` should serve as the primary entry point for any developer looking to understand, set up, and run the backend project. It should be clear, concise, and provide all the necessary information to get started.

## Structure of the README.md

1.  **Project Title:** A clear and descriptive title for the project.
2.  **Description:** A short paragraph explaining the purpose of the project (e.g., "A fully-featured backend for an e-commerce platform...").
3.  **Features:** A bulleted list highlighting the key technical features of the backend, such as:
    -   RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.
    -   JWT-based authentication (Access and Refresh Tokens).
    -   Google OAuth 2.0 for social login.
    -   File uploads handled by Multer with Cloudinary for cloud storage.
    -   MongoDB database with Mongoose ODM.
    -   Role-based access control (User, Seller, Admin).
    -   Comprehensive API documentation.
4.  **Prerequisites:** A list of software and tools that need to be installed on the local machine before setting up the project (e.g., Node.js, npm/yarn, MongoDB).
5.  **Installation & Setup:** A step-by-step guide to get the project running locally:
    -   Instructions on how to clone the repository.
    -   Command to install dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
    -   Instructions on setting up environment variables. This will involve creating a `.env` file and explaining that it should be based on a `.env.example` file.
6.  **Environment Variables:** A detailed section listing all the required environment variables from the `.env.example` file and what they are for (e.g., `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `CLOUDINARY_URL`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, etc.).
7.  **Running the Application:** Commands to start the server in different modes:
    -   `npm run dev` for development mode (with hot-reloading using `nodemon`).
    -   `npm start` for production mode.
8.  **API Documentation:** A section that directs users to the detailed API documentation. This can either be a link to a hosted documentation (like Postman or Swagger) or a reference to the markdown files within the `/backend/BackendDocs` directory.
9.  **Project Structure:** A brief overview of the main directories and their purpose (e.g., `controllers`, `models`, `routes`, `middlewares`, `services`).
